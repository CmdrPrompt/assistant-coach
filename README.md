## âœ¨ Features

- âœ… **Core Simulation Engine:**
  - **Strength & Dice Calculation:** Calculates the number of block dice (1, 2, or 3) and which coach chooses the result, based on player strength and assists.
  - **Assist Logic:** Calculates offensive and defensive assists from adjacent players, including correct handling of the `Guard` skill (engaged players can assist if they have Guard).
  - **Skill Implementation:**
    - `Guard`: Engaged players can assist blocks.
    - `Block`: Prevents Knocked Down on "Both Down".
    - `Dodge`: Converts "Defender Stumbles" to "Push" unless negated.
    - `Tackle`: Negates `Dodge` skill.
    - `Wrestle`: On "Both Down", allows both players to be Placed Prone if neither has `Block`.
    - `Dauntless`, `Horns`, `Juggernaut`, `Stand Firm`, `Fend`, `Pro`, `Brawler`, `Grab`, `Multiple Block`, `Frenzy`: (Planned/partial support)
  - **Dice Result Logic:** Applies block dice results, including reroll and skill effects, with clear outcome descriptions.
  - **Player Model:** Each player has position, strength, skills, and status (standing, prone, stunned).
  - **Test Coverage:** All core logic (block outcome, assists, dice chooser, player model, dice result application) is covered by unit tests using Vitest.

- âœ… **Interactive UI:**
  - 26Ã—15 grid-based pitch, responsive design.
  - Drag-and-drop player placement.
  - Modal popups for player creation and details.
  - Team roster management, skill display, and selection.
  - Clickable squares for block simulation and player actions.
  - Visual feedback for assists, block results, and player status.

  - Custom attributes and skills per player.

- âœ… **Testing:**
  - All main logic and UI components have dedicated test files.
  - Tests for edge cases, skill interactions, and UI behavior.
