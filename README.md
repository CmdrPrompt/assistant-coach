# Block Assistant

🧩 *Blood Bowl Block Calculator Web App*

An interactive frontend tool that calculates the number of dice rolled in blocking actions in **Blood Bowl**, based on player positions and stats.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

This app helps Blood Bowl players quickly analyze blocking situations. It's designed to support tactical decision-making both in gameplay and practice sessions and to correctly calculate the number of dice to roll in any given situation.

## ✨ Features


- ✅ **Core Simulation Engine:**
  - **Strength & Dice Calculation:** Calculates the number of block dice (1, 2, or 3) and which coach chooses the result, based on player strength and assists.
  - **Assist Logic:** Calculates offensive and defensive assists from adjacent players, with full support for the `Guard` skill (engaged players can assist if they have Guard).
  - **Skill Implementation:**
    - `Guard`: Fully implemented for assists.
    - All other skills (`Block`, `Dodge`, `Tackle`, `Wrestle`, `Dauntless`, `Horns`, `Juggernaut`, `Stand Firm`, `Fend`, `Pro`, `Brawler`, `Grab`, `Multiple Block`, `Frenzy`) are planned or partially supported only in UI or description, not in logic.
  - **Dice Result Logic:** Basic block dice result handling, but only Guard is fully supported in logic.
  - **Player Model:** Each player has position, strength, skills, and status (standing, prone, stunned).
  - **Test Coverage:** All core logic (block outcome, assists, dice chooser, player model, dice result application) is covered by unit tests using Vitest.

- ✅ **Interactive UI:**
  - 26×15 grid-based pitch, responsive design.
  - Drag-and-drop player placement.
  - Modal popups for player creation and details.
  - Team roster management, skill display, and selection.
  - Clickable squares for block simulation and player actions.
  - Visual feedback for assists, block results, and player status.

- ✅ **Data & Teams:**
  - Team rosters and player positions based on official Blood Bowl teams (CSV import).
  - Custom attributes and skills per player.

- ✅ **Testing:**
  - All main logic and UI components have dedicated test files.
  - Tests for edge cases, skill interactions, and UI behavior.
